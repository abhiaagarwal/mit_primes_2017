\subsection*{G5}

Consider the following six points in the coordinate plane:

\begin{equation*}
A = (0,1), B = (0,3), C = (1,4), D = (4,9), E = (6,7), F = (6,8)
\end{equation*}

For a point $P$ in the coordinate plane let $S(P) = PA + PB + PC + PD + PE + PF$

\subsubsection*{Part A}

Prove that S(P) is minimized at some point P.

\begin{proof}
    By the distance formula, we know that:
    
    \begin{multline*}
        S(P) = \sqrt{(P_x - A_x)^2 + (P_y - A_y)^2} + \sqrt{(P_x - B_x)^2 + (P_y - B_y)^2} + \dots \\
        + \sqrt{(P_x - F_x)^2 + (P_y - F_y)^2}
    \end{multline*}

    By substitution, we can find that the total distance function is equal to:

    \begin{multline}
        S(P) = \sqrt{(x)^2 + (y - 1)^2} + \sqrt{(x)^2 + (y - 3)^2} + \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 4)^2} \\
        + \sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + (y - 9)^2} + \sqrt{(x - 6)^2 + (y - 7)^2} + \sqrt{(x - 6)^2 + (y - 8)^2}
    \end{multline}

    The point will be between the boundaries of the minimum and maximum $x$-value and the minimum and maximum $y$-value, so $x \in [0, 6]$ and $y \in [1,9]$. By the extreme value theorem, we know that $S(P)$ must have a minimum and maximum in those intervals. 

\end{proof}

\subsubsection*{Part B}

Determine the value of that minimum.

\begin{proof}
    P is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_median}{Geometric Median}, which cannot be solved analytically. I wrote a python program to solve it:

    \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{code/g5.py}

    Running the above program with the given points, with Python 3.6.3 on MacOS, yields: 

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    >>> geometric_median(
    >>>    [(0,1),(0,3),(1,4),(4,9),(6,7),(6,8)]
    >>> )
    array([1.71518827,  4.42938511])
    \end{lstlisting}

    Therefore, we can conclude that $P \approx (1.7152, 4.4294)$

    Solving $S(P)$ with the found $P$:

    \begin{gather*}
    S(1.7152, 4.4294) \approx 22.5855
    \end{gather*}
\end{proof}
