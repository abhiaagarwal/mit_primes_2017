\subsection*{M3}

Consider integrable functions $f: [0, \pi] \mapsto [{-1}, 1]$ such that we have:

\begin{gather} \label{eq:integrable_function}
    \int_{0}^{\pi}f(x) dx = 0
\end{gather}

and let:

\begin{gather} \label{eq:m3}
    S(f) = \int_{0}^{\pi} f(x)\sin(x) dx
\end{gather}

Find a constant $M$, as small as you can, for which $|S(f)| \leq M$

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\begin{proof}
From the fundamental theorem of Calculus, we know that:
